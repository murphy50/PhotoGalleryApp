# PhotoGalleryApp

PhotoGalleryApp is an iOS application designed to showcase a collection of photos. Users can view photos, add new ones, and save them to their device. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for a clean and organized codebase.

## Features

- **View Photos:** Browse through a collection of photos in a gallery format.
- **Add Photos:** Upload new photos from the device's photo library.
- **Save Photos:** Save selected photos to the device's photo album.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Utilizes MVVM for separating concerns and improving code maintainability.

## MVVM Architecture

- **Model:** Represents the data structure and logic, such as fetching photos from a server or managing local storage.
- **View:** Displays the user interface and interacts with the user.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, preparing data for display and handling user interactions.
- **The MVVM architecture** promotes separation of concerns and testability, making it easier to maintain and extend the application.
